## What is it?

**BrewSweep** scans your installed Homebrew packages (both formulas and casks) and displays them sorted by last access time. This makes it easy to identify:

- **Never-used packages** - Installed but never accessed
- **Rarely-used packages** - Haven't been used in months or years  
- **Recently-used packages** - Actively used packages to keep

The tool provides a clean, interactive interface for viewing package details and safely removing unused packages to free up disk space. **Sweep away the clutter** and keep only what you actually use!

## Features

### üìä **Smart Package Analysis**
- **Real-time scanning** of all Homebrew formulas and casks

## Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. **Start the application**
   ```bash
   brewsweep
   ```

2. **Scan packages**
   - Press `Space` to start scanning your Homebrew installation
   - Watch real-time progress as packages are discovered

3. **Browse packages**
   - Use `‚Üë`/`‚Üì` arrow keys to navigate the package list
   - Packages are automatically sorted with least-used first

4. **View details**
   - Press `Enter` on any package to see detailed information
   - View last access time, type, and installation path

5. **Delete packages**
   - Press `d` to delete a selected package
   - Confirm with `y` or cancel with `n`
   - Watch real-time output from the `brew uninstall` command

### Keyboard Controls

#### Main Table
| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Space` | Start package scan |
| `‚Üë`/`‚Üì` | Navigate up/down |
| `‚Üê`/`‚Üí` | Navigate left/right |
| `Enter` | View package details |
| `d` | Delete selected package |
| `r` | Refresh (re-scan packages) |
| `Shift + ‚Üí` | Next color theme |
| `Shift + ‚Üê` | Previous color theme |
| `Esc` | Quit application |

#### Package Details

| `y`/`Enter` | Confirm deletion |
| `n`/`Space` | Cancel deletion |
| `Esc` | Quit application |


### Package Information Display

The tool displays packages with the following information:

- **Package Name** - The Homebrew package identifier
- **Type** - Formula (command-line tool) or Cask (GUI application)
- **Last Accessed** - Human-readable time since last use:
  - "Never accessed" - Package never used
  - "2 hours ago" - Recently used
  - "3 months ago" - Moderately old
  - "1 year ago" - Very old, candidate for removal
- **Path** - Installation location on your system

### Sorting Logic

Packages are automatically sorted by usage to prioritize cleanup candidates:

1. **Never accessed packages** (top of list)
   - Easiest to identify for removal
   - Safe to delete if you don't recognize them

2. **Oldest accessed packages** 
   - Haven't been used in months/years
   - Good candidates for cleanup

3. **Recently accessed packages** (bottom of list)
   - Actively used, probably should keep
   - Latest access times
